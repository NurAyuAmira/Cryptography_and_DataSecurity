# Implementation of RSA Cryptosystem

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the RSA Cryptosystem, focusing on its implementation, encryption, and decryption processes using prime numbers. It delves into the mathematical foundations of RSA, such as modular arithmetic and the use of public and private keys for secure communication.

## Project Duration

**Dec 2023 - Mar 2024**

## Features

- **Mathematical Foundations:** Detailed exploration of modular arithmetic and the RSA algorithm's theoretical underpinnings.
- **Key Generation:** Implementation of RSA key generation using large prime numbers.
- **Encryption & Decryption:** Practical coding of the RSA encryption and decryption processes.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Comparative analyses with symmetric encryption techniques like S-AES to demonstrate RSA's effectiveness.
